Tic Tac Toe
Artificial Intelligence, Fall 2014

This tic tac toe program allows a player to play tic tac toe against a computer that never loses (but occasionally ties). The computer uses a minimax algorithm. 

To run this program, run the LoadGame.java file. From there a GUI interface will load with 9 buttons. Press a button and the game begins. Reports of winning or losing will be displayed in the command window.
